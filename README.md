- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tnoxious
- 👀 I’m interested in linux servers and programing in all types of programing languages and a fan of open source  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning linux from scratch, Blender skills and lua coding on the side
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that supports open source code!  
- 📫 How to reach me best to contact me on my website noxiousnexus.com
- 😄 Pronouns: ...theorists would not consider them to form a single class? Got no idea what else to say about it lol
